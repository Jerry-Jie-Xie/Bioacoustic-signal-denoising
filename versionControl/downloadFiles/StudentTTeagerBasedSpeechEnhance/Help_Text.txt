These Matlab codes are the implementation of algorithm presented in
"Speech Enhancement Based on Student t Modeling of Teager Energy Operated
Perceptual Wavelet Packet Coefficients and a Custom Thresholding Function"
by M. T. Islam, C. Shahnaz, W. P. Zhu and M. O. Ahmad submitted to 
IEEE TSALP.

The main code runs from Main_File.m. A sample audio file 
"sp05_babble_sn15.wav" which is taken from NOIZEUS database,is taken as
the noisy speech file in the above code and an enhanced speech file is
produced as output.
