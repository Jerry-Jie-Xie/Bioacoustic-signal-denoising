function ReconstructedSignal=OverlapAdd1(XNEW, windowLen, ShiftLen)

%Y=OverlapAdd(X,A,W,S);
%Y is the signal reconstructed signal from its spectrogram. X is a matrix
%with each column being the fft of a segment of signal. A is the phase
%angle of the spectrum which should have the same dimension as X. if it is
%not given the phase angle of X is used which in the case of real values is
%zero (assuming that its the magnitude). W is the window length of time
%domain segments if not given the length is assumed to be twice as long as
%fft window length. S is the shift length of the segmentation process ( for
%example in the case of non overlapping signals it is equal to W and in the
%case of %50 overlap is equal to W/2. if not givven W/2 is used. Y is the
%reconstructed time domain signal.
